        <h4>Howard Hawk</h4>
        <p class="subText">Chief Medical</p>
        <h5>Your child shines with every smile. Let's keep it that way!</h5>
        <p>To say that Dr. Howard Hawk loves his work as a pediatric dentist is the ultimate understatement. Being silly with
          his young patients is one of his favorite things and one of the reasons why he chose pediatric dentistry as a career.</p>
        <p>Dr. Howard takes pride in his ability to transform a fearful child into a happy patient who leaves the DentaKids
          office unafraid and confident that a trip to the dentist can be fun! Dr. Howard Hawk graduated from the University
          of the Pacific School of Dentistry in 1995 with its highest honors. He received his certificate in Pediatric Dentistry
          at Harvard University/Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Boston in 1997.</p>
